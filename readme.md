## Project Description

This result of this project will be a personal portfolio site displaying my various software development projects. It will also contain About Me, Contact Me, and Frontend/Backend Skills information. It will initially be built as a single static page application. It will be built mobile-first with responsive design for larger devices using CSS flex and grid displays. It will use API calls to a Google Sheet where the various projects will be stored. It will be deployed via GitHub to Netlify and/or Vercel.
